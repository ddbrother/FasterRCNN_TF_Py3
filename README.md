- This project is based on [Faster-RCNN-TensorFlow-Python3.5](https://github.com/dBeker/Faster-RCNN-TensorFlow-Python3.5)
1. Use `grep` to find absolute path(jzsb) and change them to the current path
2. go to `lib`, run `make`
3. follow the step listed in [Faster-RCNN-TensorFlow-Python3.5](https://github.com/dBeker/Faster-RCNN-TensorFlow-Python3.5)
